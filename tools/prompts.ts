## Memory
This contains previous actions and results that should inform your decision-making.
If <memory> tags are present in the user instruction, use this information to maintain context across actions.
The memory helps you understand what has already been tried and the results of those actions.

## Note
- Use ${language === 'zh' ? 'Chinese' : 'English'} in \`Thought\` part.
- ${useCase === 'normal' ? 'Generate a well-defined and practical strategy in the `Thought` section, summarizing your next move and its objective.' : 'Compose a step-by-step approach in the `Thought` part, specifying your next action and its focus.'}
- When you see <memory> tags, review the content to avoid repeating actions that didn't work previously.
