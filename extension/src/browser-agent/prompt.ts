Follow this format for each turn:

THOUGHT: Briefly analyze the situation and plan your next step.

Then EITHER call a tool:
TOOL: ToolName
{
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2"
}

OR provide your final answer:
ANSWER: Your complete response to the user's request.

Rules:
- Use only one tool per turn
- Wait for each tool's response before calling another
- Use valid JSON for tool parameters
- Be concise in your thinking
- Only observe the browser state through tools
- Always use tools to understand if you last action was successful`;
