# Telegram Integration

Iris can send automation status notifications via Telegram for real-time monitoring of your automation tasks.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Use the `/newbot` command and follow the instructions
3. Choose a name and username for your bot
4. Copy the bot token provided by BotFather
5. Add this token to your `.env` file as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

### 2. Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a conversation with your newly created bot
2. Send any message to the bot (e.g., "Hello")
3. Visit the following URL in your browser, replacing `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token:
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
4. Look for the `chat.id` field in the JSON response
5. Add this chat ID to your `.env` file as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

### 3. Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
