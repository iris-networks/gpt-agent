build me a xfce docker container with x11 server and vnc. my requirements are simple, it should use light screen, should be
responsive to screen size changes and should have chromium. when a user logs in using vnc server, they should be logged in with a user that cannot access my source code, they should not be able to see the code as its proprietry. use the internet to download a stable version of chromium please. make a good looking image please. should build for linux platform         

use build cache, so successive builds are faster
use node 20, check dist folder for structure
