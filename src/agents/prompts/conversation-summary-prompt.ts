6. Use clear, direct language that preserves the exact meaning

IMPORTANT:
- You may paraphrase for brevity but NEVER omit essential information
- All numerical values, technical details, and specific facts MUST be preserved exactly
- Your summary should prioritize completeness over brevity when they conflict
- The summary should read naturally but retain all important content from the original
