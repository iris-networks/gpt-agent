# The Purpose Behind gpt-agents (aka Iris)

We understand that as developers and innovators, you're looking for powerful tools that don't come with prohibitive costs or limitations. The promise of AI-driven computer automation is immense, but the current market often presents a significant financial barrier. Proprietary solutions often demand hundreds of dollars per month and restrict access.

This is why we created gpt-agents (aka Iris).

gpt-agents (aka Iris) is our answer to this challenge: a completely free, open-source alternative designed to give you full control over your computer's automation capabilities. We believe that advanced AI tools should be accessible to everyone, allowing you to focus on building and creating, not on managing subscriptions.

## Why gpt-agents (aka Iris)? The Value of Open Access and Collaboration

Many platforms offering agent-like capabilities for computer automation come with substantial monthly fees and often have regional restrictions. Proprietary solutions such as Manus.im and others in the market can carry steep price tags (up to $200/month) and may have limited availability or features.

*   **ChatGPT Agent/OpenAI Operator:** While powerful, these often carry a steep price tag (up to $200/month) and can have limited availability.
*   **ChatGPT Plus:** Offers basic capabilities for $20/month but lacks the depth of true computer automation.
*   **gpt-agents (aka Iris):** Provides **advanced, full-spectrum computer automation at zero cost.**

Our development team, much like many of you, operates with focused hours. This means we've primarily focused our current efforts on ensuring gpt-agents (aka Iris) is robust and easily deployable via Docker containers. This approach allows us to provide a stable, usable experience now, while also laying the groundwork for future expansion.

The decision to open-source gpt-agents (aka Iris) is a strategic one. We want to empower developers like us, and indeed developers worldwide, to contribute to expanding gpt-agents (aka Iris) across all operating systems and use cases. By fostering this collaborative environment, we can collectively keep projects competitive and ensure this powerful automation technology is accessible and adaptable for everyone.
